       Hello viewers,  I am Rahul Sinha a Photographer and a Tablist.
       </p>
       <p>
       From a very young age I started looking things from an unseen
       perspective of view and then started clicking them. I find
       nature as the most beautful thing, So i thought of devoting
       myself to photography as it gives me happiness.  And I believe
       cameras dont make stories, your eyes does. And once you've
       mastered creating visuals in your mind, You are going to go a
       long way out. I do photography as a passion and i dont want
       anything out of it. It gives me a reason to live the life I
       love.So i decided to join Fototechnik School Of Photography in 2019.

       And the thing that drags my attention the most is instruments and musical's.
   </p>
   <p>
       I love to create musical sounds with my tabla beats and enjoy playing them.
       When i was young my parents used to notice that whenever a song is being played i bang the table to match their beats.
       They decided to give me tabla taalim from a renouned tabla artist Ashit Tarafdar. Its been 7 years i am playing tabla and till thid date I play them with love and respect. They are my freshers and i do it as a hobby.
